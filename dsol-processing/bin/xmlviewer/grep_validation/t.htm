    <h2>   Accommodations for Special Needs Students: What We   <em>    Can   </em>   Do  </h2>
    <p> By Victoria S. Hagedorn
        <br/>
        <br/> Victoria S. Hagedorn is a music teacher at Walsingham Elementary School in Pinellas County, Florida..
        <br/>
        <br/> As many schools move into full inclusion, accommodations must be made for special-needs students in the general music education class. "Accommodations involve a wide range of techniques and support systems that help students with a disability work around any limitations that result from their disability" (Beech, 1999, p. 1). Successful teaching of special needs children depends on the educator's ability to adapt, which includes adapting materials and instruments for them. Small changes in how instruction is provided can powerfully impact student learning. Beech suggests that one must consider how the special needs student will acquire information and skills, as well as how he or she will demonstrate new knowledge and skills. </p>
    <p> In the general music class, teachers may be called upon to work with students who have difficulties with reading, understanding oral instruction, or mathematics. This article addresses these issues and innovative ways to deal with them. </p>
    <p> <strong>    Addressing Common Problems   </strong>
        <br/> <em>    Reading difficulties.   </em> Reading difficulties may be manifested in general music class by how the student interacts with the music basal text. Multiple lines of text from a song underneath a single staff are difficult enough for a strong reader. In addition, acclimating any student to skipping visually from one staff to the next while following the text can be a challenge. The music teacher needs to be concerned with the vocabulary in the lyrics, how the student visually follows the text, and alternate ways for the student to experience complex information. Marking the text with highlighters and sticky notes is one way to accommodate a student who has difficulty with the visual tracking skills necessary to follow the words in a music score. </p>
    <p> Understanding words, phrases, and sentences used in the music text is another difficulty for a poor reader. Providing pictures, diagrams, or manipulatives to coincide with difficult information in the music text can assist a student in comprehending reading material. For example, the special needs student may become confused if the concept of half steps is presented solely in written language. Visuals like a keyboard or diagrams on the board and hands-on activities such as using resonator bells are ways to assist the limited reader in understanding this concept. </p>
    <p> <em>    Difficulties understanding oral instruction.   </em> Many special needs students have difficulty following lectures or discussion. Maintaining attention, following ideas, and interpreting oral information are problematic for them. </p>
    <p> Prior to instruction, the educator can accommodate these learners by using overhead projectors, charts, and the chalkboard as organizers. During instruction, sequencing cards can present material in a logical manner as well as provide transitions. These cards can be pictorial or simple one-or-two-word written verbal cues. Also, writing down important ideas in color on the board or a chart (the traditional "chalk and talk") during instruction can help students by providing them with visual codes. </p>
    <p> <em>    Mathematical difficulties.   </em> Concrete materials can accommodate students who have problems following the mathematical concepts and processes used in rhythms. Pupils can use manipulatives such as rhythm cards that help them understand the ratio of length to sound (for example one inch for a quarter note, two inches for a half note, four inches for a whole note, and so forth). </p>
    <p> Several commercial products available in the music catalogs provide manipulatives in the form of charts, flash cards, and notation materials. In addition, it may be necessary for the teacher to provide a reference chart or table with the basic notation facts on them. </p>
    <p> The use of flowcharts can assist students in the mathematical processes needed for such activities as filling in blank measures based on the meter or figuring out the number of counts in a measure. </p>
    <p> <em>    Assistive technology.   </em> Another method of accommodation can be employed by using "assistive technology," a set of tools that can "help our kids interact with and function more independently and successfully in the world around them" (Sweeney, 1999, online). Assistive technology is defined as "any device, whether it's purchased off the shelf, home-made, or modified, that helps people with special needs maintain or increase their functional capabilities" (Sweeney, 1999). It can be as low or high tech as one needs it to be. </p>
    <p> According to Sweeney, assistive technology can be classified into four categories: (1) cognitive devices, which include computers and switch-operated devices, (2) augmentative communication devices for those without speech, (3) mobility devices such as walkers and wheelchairs, and (4) environmental control devices, which are any devices used to help people live in and control their environments. This last category contains devices that may be "low tech" but are nevertheless highly effective. </p>
    <p> <strong>    The LoTTIE Kit   </strong>
        <br/> The "LoTTIE" Kit was presented at a recent workshop related to the general inclusion of special needs students (not specific to music instruction). "LoTTIE," which stands for <u>    L   </u> ow <u>    T   </u> ech <u>    T   </u> ools for <u>    I   </u> nclusive <u>    E   </u> ducation, is a commercially available kit containing small items for use with students in grades KÂ12. The kit was initially designed for use with reading, writing, and mathematics, and is designed to help general and special education students, as well as assistants, therapists, parents, and any person working with special needs students. </p>
    <p> Initially, it might seem that this kit has no relevance to music instruction. It includes many items that do not pertain specifically to teaching music, such as a money calculator, rubber stamp sets, and a talking clock. On closer inspection, however, it contains several suitable items that could be valuable in presenting music to students of all ages. Many of these items can be obtained by buying the kit, but most of them can be found in a local office supply store. Following are suggestions for using some of the items found in the LoTTIE Kit in music class. </p>
    <p> <em>    Tabs.   </em> Several kinds of tabs, or flags, are on the LoTTIE list. Some of these are of the Post-It note variety and can be removed and reused. For elementary students using a music text, pages can easily be marked so that students can find the day's lesson quickly and successfully. In addition, markers such as adhesive arrows or colored tabs can be placed on the music where the child needs to focus, such as on a fermata or an accent. Use of these tabs can also help the non-English speaking child to locate places in written material easier and thus function better in class. </p>
    <p> Another use for these tabs is to put them on keyboards or melody bells. Many times teachers have marked bells with stickers, only to find the adhesive will not come off after the exercise is over. Attaching removable, color-coded tabs is a more suitable way to guide children as they play bells. Simply assigning one color to the right hand and another color to the left hand can be a big help. </p>
    <p> <em>    Highlighting.   </em> Using highlighters is a known way to quickly focus students' attention visually. However, music teachers should also consider the benefits of newer erasable highlighters or highlighting tape (similar to white-out tape). A second verse could be highlighted with a highlighting tape or pen for students who use music texts at the elementary levels. Thus, when the first verse is finished, the teacher could instruct the child to look at the colored part and follow along. The same idea could be used for part-singing in the elementary music classroom. A melody could be highlighted in one color, while the harmony could be highlighted in another. Certainly, planning would be necessary in deciding which parts to highlight, but the ease of the children's ability to follow along will outweigh the time invested in preparing the music. </p>
    <p> <em>    Pencil grips/Velcro.   </em> The pencil grips that many students use for fun can provide an extra aid to special needs students. Attaching pencil grips to mallets and strikers can assist students who have difficulty manipulating these items. Trial and error will show which grips are effective for which sized mallets or strikers. Such assistance may also benefit non-handicapped students. For example, kindergartners may find that adding grippers to triangle strikers will help in holding them. </p>
    <p> Velcro is a wonderful tool for students who have difficulty manipulating or holding instruments. For example, attaching a section of self-adhesive Velcro to one clave and connecting the reciprocal piece of Velcro to a desk or tabletop surface can allow a student who has manipulation problems in one hand to play a two-handed instrument. The child could tap one clave held in the hand to the clave held in place by the Velcro on a tabletop or music stand. This approach could work with other materials and instruments as well. </p>
    <p> <em>    White boards.   </em> A special needs child can use individual portable white boards and markers for written or oral assignments. A child who has difficulty responding verbally can answer a verbal question from the teacher with a written response on the white board. The markers are larger than a pencil or pen, and the writing surface is larger than a piece of paper. To complete a written assignment such as making a rhythm pattern or writing answers to a test, the child can respond on the white board, show the answer to the teacher, and then erase it. This accommodation allows the student more opportunities to participate and be a part of the class, and offers the teacher another means of assessment. </p>
    <p> <strong>    Summary   </strong>
        <br/> The tools discussed here are suggestions for easy, readily available, and affordable ways to present information and receive feedback from special needs students. Certainly such low tech tools can help all the students in your class, making your teaching easier and saving students' and educators' time during frequently performed simple tasks like finding a page number or a place in the music. Implementing these tools in class can circumvent problems for students who have reading, sequencing, attention, and responding difficulties. </p>
    <p> The entire LoTTIE Kit, which costs over $300, may not be economical to purchase. However, items in the kit are sold separately. If an item is needed that is unavailable in the local office supply store, it can be purchased for a reasonable price from the following Web site: http://There are interesting links and articles at this site in addition to the catalog of items. </p>
    <p> It is the educator's responsibility to find ways to accommodate inclusion students' learning needs. Music educators will find using assistive technology helpful in bringing students together in music learning experiences. </p>
