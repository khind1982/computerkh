  <p>It seems that you are trying to access an XML viewer that does not exist.</p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right fa-2x"></i>If the viewer you are trying to access is for a new product it could be that the product has not been configured yet. In this case please contact Roeland Schumacher.</p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i>If the viewer you are trying to access is for a new user on an existing product please follow these steps to set up a new user.
  In a UNIX session, logged into dsol (very important), run the following command:</p>

  <p class="unix">cp /opt/DSol/apache2/htdocs/xmlviewer/{product} /index_{existing_user}.php  /opt/DSol/apache2/htdocs/xmlviewer/{product}/index_{new_user}.php</p>


  <p>Be sure to replace {product}, {existing_user} and {new_user} with the appropriate values.</p>
